Today I started with the AOZ daily and updated my journal. Then we had an AOZxLiip refinement session and an Apprentice ZH tactical. After that I joined a Liip Talk about Google Translate for sign language. Later we did a sync on AOZ-27 to align on next tasks. I spent the rest of the day working on AOZ-27 and did some research to clarify open questions.
