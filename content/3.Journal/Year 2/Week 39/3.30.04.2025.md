Today I started with the AOZxLiip daily and the Apprentice daily. Then I worked on my Zebra timesheets and updated the journal. After that I spent most of the day on AOZ-27 and finished coding the desktop design for the teaser component. I also did some extra research to check edge cases and ensure it works as expected.
