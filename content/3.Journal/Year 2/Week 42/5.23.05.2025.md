In English, we had our most normal lesson. We talked about random topics again. But it was a lot of fun, and I learned a few new words. Later, I had sports, where we played discus throwing. I played very poorly and only earned a few points, but still got an ü.a. (übertroffene anforderungen). Later, we had our exams, for example, on the topic "Sollen Frauen auch Wehrdienst leisten?" I got good grades in all of them. :)
