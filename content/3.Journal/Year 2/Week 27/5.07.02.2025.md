I started the day with my usual daily routine before attending the first session of an onboarding program. After that, I updated the Zebra Timesheets and journal entries to keep everything recorded properly. The rest of the day was spent finalizing the patches for all Drupal projects, ensuring everything was fully implemented and working as expected. Now I had to wait till every developer from each project accepted my changes. If they accept it, then I can set a checkmark in my check list document in my google drive.
