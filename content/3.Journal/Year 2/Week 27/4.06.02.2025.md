I began the day with my usual daily task. Then I spent a good chunk of time fixing errors for some Drupal projects that had come up. Once the issues were resolved, I moved on to updating the Zebra Timesheets and journal entries to stay up-to-date. The final task of the day was continuing to create patches locally for all Drupal projects. I focused on ensuring that everything was in working order for smoother development going forward.
