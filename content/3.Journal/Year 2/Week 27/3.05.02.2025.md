I started with my daily together with Trent. After that, I worked on fixing errors in various Drupal projects, which took quite some time since some issues were trickier than expected. Later, I updated my timesheets and journal to keep track of everything properly. The main focus of the day, however, was continuing the process of creating patches locally for every Drupal project, ensuring that all systems were up-to-date and functioning as expected.
