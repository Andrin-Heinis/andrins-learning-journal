I started the day with English in the morning. Afterwards, I had two tests: one in GS about insurances and the other in SK on business letters. In the GS test, which focused on topics like the solidarity principle and the three-pillar system, I scored a 4.9. In the SK test, where I had to write a business letter about “Replacement for secured items that were damaged by a storm”, I got a 5.6. I was satisfied with my SK result.
