I started with my daily as usual. After that, I worked on tickets EKW-3212 and EKW-3213. I continued improving the hover spacing and fixed the title on one of the components. I spent some time cleaning up the code and making sure everything was consistent. Later, I had the daily for Migros Karriere and joined the sync meeting. In the afternoon, I went to the UX-Day in Zürich. It was an interesting event with a lot of creative input. We talked about how to improve the UI in an elevator. You can compare it with an actual website and then you will see that it’s important to have a good UI everywhere.
