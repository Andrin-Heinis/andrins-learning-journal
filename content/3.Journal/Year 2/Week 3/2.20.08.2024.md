Another day, another step closer to mastering Vue 3. Today was entirely devoted to continuing the second part of the course, and I’m pleased to say that I’m nearing its completion. The lessons are starting to connect in a cohesive way, and I can see how all the pieces fit together. To reinforce what I’ve learned, I took some time to review the earlier modules. This quick review was beneficial as it helped to strengthen the foundational concepts, making the more advanced topics easier to grasp.
