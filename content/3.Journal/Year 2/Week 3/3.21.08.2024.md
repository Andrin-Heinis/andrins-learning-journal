Today was a milestone in my learning journeyâ€”I finally completed the second part of the Vue 3 course! The sense of accomplishment was palpable, as this section had been particularly challenging. With the course behind me, I spent the remainder of the day experimenting with the newly acquired concepts. I set up small projects on my own, applying what I had learned in practical scenarios. This hands-on experimentation not only solidified my understanding but also boosted my confidence in using Vue 3 in real-world applications.
