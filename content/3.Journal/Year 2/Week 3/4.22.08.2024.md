Today was my first school day. I was very excited to see everybody and some new students who started their apprenticeship that year. In the first two lessons we had Modul 322. In that Modul we worked with: “Design and implement user interfaces”. It was very interesting, because already in the first lesson I learned many things. In the other lesions I had other Modules: 320, 426, 346. After a short break we had math. We started with a new theme.
