Today was a school day. We started with module 322. I had to give a presentation on two different ways to build a product. This presentation does not count towards the grade. The next lesson we had cloud systems. We worked with the Amazon cloud system, which was very interesting. I never thought I would like it so much! After that we had lunch, followed by module 426, where we learned how to develop software using agile methods. That was a bit boring to be honest. Shortly after that we had module 346 and then math, which was very interesting. I like the topic we are currently covering.
