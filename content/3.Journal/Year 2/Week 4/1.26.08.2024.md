Kicking off the new week, I dived into the third part of the Vue 3 course, which focuses on URL parameters. The topic is incredibly interesting and opens up new possibilities in web development. However, as I progressed, I encountered several points that required further clarification. This led me to do a fair amount of googling, which was somewhat frustrating at times but ultimately rewarding. The additional research deepened my understanding, and I ended the day with a richer grasp of the subject. Despite the challenges, I learned a lot and am eager to continue this journey.
