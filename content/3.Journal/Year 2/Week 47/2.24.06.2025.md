I didn't get very far today. I had a lot of errors I had to fix, etc. I also had to do a lot of other things, like prepare for the team talk. In AOZ, I continued working on the gallery component. My goal today was to be able to select multiple images instead of just one. I managed it after a long time. Then I prepared for the team talk. I rented a room for it. The team talk was later, and it turned out pretty well. Then I continued writing my journal and then I went home.
