Today we continued creating our website. I tried to create a logo but it didn’t look like how I wanted it. But that's ok because next time I know what I want to add to the logo. In math, we got our tests back, and it went pretty well. The test had three parts, but the last part wasn’t covered in class, so it didn’t count. Overall, I scored 13 out of 16 points (without the last part), which I thought was okay, considering the test was harder than the previous ones.
