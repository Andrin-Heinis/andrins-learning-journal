Today I had Judo. I got to school at 13:15. I was very lucky with the time. In the Dojo (Training Place on japanese) we met our 2 trainers. And to be honest, I learned more how to fly and land without taking much pain than throwing someone else. But overall it was a funny and intensive training. I liked it and it reminded me of the time ago when I did karate.
