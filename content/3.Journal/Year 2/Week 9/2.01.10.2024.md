I spent my time learning about Functions and Filters. Functions are a fundamental concept that Iâ€™ve seen across many programming languages, so I breezed through most of the lesson. However, I found the part on filters particularly useful in the context of PHP. After finishing the video, I practiced writing a few functions and applying filters to ensure I fully understood how to handle data in PHP.
