I started the day by spending 2 hours fixing the Starterkit on my own. I identified the issues with the current version, applied updates, and ensured everything was functioning as expected. Later, I dedicated 6 hours to the PHP course, focusing on repeating and reinforcing Parts II and III. This included revisiting topics like handling databases, creating dynamic web pages, and improving performance and security. Working through the material again helped to sort my understanding and clear up any doubts I had.
