When I arrived at the office, I immediately started troubleshooting and adding missing code for AOZ-27. For example, I had to fix the buttons for switching between teasers in the mobile version. I tried so hard and got so far, but in the end, it didn't work. Then we had the daily task, where I asked Jens to solve the problem. He agreed, and we tried to solve it. Because it was difficult, we couldn't solve it. Then I continued working with the missing part. I had to activate the field_text in GraphQL to see it in the Teaser Liste. After that I started reading and setting up AOZ-40.
