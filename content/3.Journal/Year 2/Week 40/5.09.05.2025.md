On Friday morning, we first had an English lesson. Since we had all forgotten our presentations, we talked about the new pope and politics in English. That was very interesting and we learned a lot of new things. Later we had a basketball lesson. I didn't like that at all because we did it outside and it was very cold. Later we had German, and there we informed ourselves and prepared about a topic: whether women also have to do compulsory military service in Switzerland, because in Denmark it's officially been that way since this summer. I wrote down a lot of information because we have to write an essay on it next week.
