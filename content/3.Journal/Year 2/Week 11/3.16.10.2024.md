I joined a meeting with Trent today. It was a Sprint Review, Planning, and Retrospective for the WebBS project. We discussed the progress weâ€™ve made so far and then planned the upcoming tasks. In the afternoon, I focused on working through ticket ASVZ-719. This ticket was quite involved and required several backend adjustments to add the needed functionalities. Overall, it was an intense but productive day.
