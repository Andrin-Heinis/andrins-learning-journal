Today I started with the AOZ daily to quickly align with the team. After that I spent the whole day working on AOZ-27 and made extremely big progress on the teaser component. I focused especially on the mobile version and managed to finish the entire mobile design implementation. I also cleaned up some of the old code and tested different breakpoints to be sure it all looks good on various screen sizes. It was a super productive day where I got further than I originally expected.
