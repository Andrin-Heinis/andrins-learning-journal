I started with my daily tasks, working together with Trent as usual. After that, I spent an hour designing a presentation for Natourli, focusing on creating a clear and visually appealing layout. I then spent 0.75 hours setting up DDEV and Platform.sh by myself, working through the setup process step-by-step. The biggest part of my day was dedicated to my PHP course, where I invested 6 hours in part III, continuing to deepen my understanding and build on what I learned previously.
