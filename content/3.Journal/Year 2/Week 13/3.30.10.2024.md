I spent an hour reviewing software updates to stay up-to-date with the latest changes. Most of my day, however, was focused on the PHP course, where I put in 7 hours to continue with part III and strengthen my skills. I also worked with Trent to continue setting up DDEV and make sure everything was running smoothly.
