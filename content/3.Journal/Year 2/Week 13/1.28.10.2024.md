I started my day with the usual daily tasks, working alongside Trent. After that, I spent two hours in an ergonomics base training to make sure I know how to set up my workspace in a healthy way. I learned many things and it was interesting to see how others set up their workspace. Then, I worked on hosting for an hour to improve connections and ensure everything runs smoothly. The biggest part of my day, though, was dedicated to my PHP course, where I spent 4.75 hours on part III to deepen my understanding and really grasp the new concepts.
