I started my daily with Trent as usual. After that, I spent 5 hours adding my composer setup to every Drupal project, making sure everything was correctly configured. Between that work session, I participated in the Natourli sprint 1 planning for 1 hour, discussing the next steps and organizing the workflow for the upcoming sprint. After the second part of the working session where I add my plugin to every Drupal project, I spent 2 hours updating my learning journal, documenting past tasks and progress. It was an interesting day because I was able to be in a sprint planning for the first time.
