I spent 6.75 hours continuing my work on creating and installing Composer across all Drupal projects. The process involved refining the setup, fixing compatibility issues, and ensuring everything was properly configured. Some projects required additional adjustments, but I managed to get everything working as expected in the projects I was working on today. Later, I spent 1 hour preparing for the Natourli presentation together with Jana, Laura, Sarah and Severin. This preparation was important to ensure a smooth and well-structured presentation.
