I spent the day at school. In Modul 320, we prepared for the upcoming test on inheritance, polymorphism, UML, and visibility, going through key concepts and coding exercises. We also worked on implementing "is a" and "has a" relationships in GameObjects. In Modul 346, I worked on KN03, setting up Cloud-init with AWS, following the steps in the KN03 guide.
