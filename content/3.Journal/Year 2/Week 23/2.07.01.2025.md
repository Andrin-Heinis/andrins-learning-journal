I started with my daily with Trent as usual. After that, I spent 7 hours working on creating a Composer plugin and installing it across multiple Drupal projects. This involved setting up configurations, ensuring compatibility, and debugging issues that came up during installation. Some projects required manual adjustments, but I managed to get everything running smoothly. Later, I joined the Drupal ZH Team Talks for 0.75 hours, where we discussed project updates, upcoming tasks, and improvements for workflow efficiency.
