I started with my daily with Trent as usual and then continued with the daily session at Migros with Sergio. After that, we had a short sync session to align on our current status. Later, I attended the Apprentice ZH tactical meeting. For the rest of the day, I focused on the tickets EKW-3212 and EKW-3213. I spent most of my time refining the hover functionality, this time rewriting it using Tailwind and making further improvements to the code quality.
