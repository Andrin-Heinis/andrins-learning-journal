In the morning at professional school, I continued learning about the basics of SQL versus NoSQL. I managed to start a small project and got it running successfully using Docker containers. I also launched the application and inserted car images as part of the exercise. Additionally, I configured the database to link car data using MySQL with the help of a Visual Studio Code extension. Later, I focused on connecting to a NoSQL database, where I learned more about MongoDB, including its structure and key concepts like documents and key/value pairs. It was an interesting day with a lot of practical database work.
