I started with my daily with Trent as usual, then I joined the Migros Karriere Daily. After that, I had a short sync meeting. The rest of the day I focused on working through the tickets EKW-3212 and EKW-3213. I had some trouble figuring out how to properly handle the hover text for the dots and had to ask for help a couple of times. Despite that, I managed to clean up the code and make solid progress. Overall it was a productive day, even if the issue with the dots slowed me down a bit.
