I went through the lesson on Conditionals and Booleans today. It was a bit longer than some previous lessons, but I had already covered these concepts in other programming languages, so it was mostly a review. I took some extra time to practice the syntax and how conditions can be combined. It was a great refresher, especially with the calm and clear explanations. I feel confident with this material.
