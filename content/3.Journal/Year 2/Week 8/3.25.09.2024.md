Today's focus was on Arrays. While arrays are something I am quite familiar with, I appreciated how the course showed examples specific to PHP, such as how arrays can be manipulated. I went over the lesson twice to ensure I got everything right, especially when working with indexed and associative arrays. It's fascinating to see how PHP handles arrays compared to other languages.
