When I arrived at the office, I was busy with a lot of administrative tasks, like updating timesheets and checking all the emails. Then I had the daily meeting with the AOZ team. After the daily meeting, I continued working on the tests, as I had to fix the last few errors. It actually went better than I expected, but it took a long time. Unfortunately, I still wasn't finished at the end of the day. Later, I went to play pool with the Apprentices Circle and ate burgers. That was really cool, and the burger was delicious ðŸ˜‹.
