Today I wrote tests for the teaser I've been working on for the past few weeks. I had to do a lot of research on sites like Vue Testing and Vue Test Utils before I could get started. After gaining enough experience, I was able to get started and created all the tests with ChatGPT. Finally, I checked it with Noah, and it turned out I had tested the tests incorrectly. I had about 26 error messages. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to do it today, but I'm sure I'll get to it tomorrow.
