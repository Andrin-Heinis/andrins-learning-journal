In the morning I continued on the PHP course, and I came to the part where I had to type in the correct file directions. Somehow I didn’t make it even when I followed the tutorial. But it was ok, because I didn’t program that much so after a short check I will find the issue(s).
In the afternoon Trent and I continued on the bs.ch website. We started at a new page and it's called Newsletter. After that I continued on the PHP course again. It was a long day but a cool one. Also we had and Tactical today but in Drupal.
