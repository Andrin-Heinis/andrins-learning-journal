Today I started a project on the bs.ch website. I also made my first changes, and it was… 🥁🥁🥁… improving the ReadMe.md file! :D Together with Trent, I set everything up, and during the setup, I missed a step because it wasn’t in the tutorial. After asking Trent, he said I could add the missing step to the ReadMe file to complete it. It wasn’t a big change, but it was a crazy moment because it was my first change in a big project.
