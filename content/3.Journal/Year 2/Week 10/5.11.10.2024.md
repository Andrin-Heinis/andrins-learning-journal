Today when I woke up I felt very sick, normally when I take a shower I will feel better, but today I had a lot of headache and also I couldnâ€™t see normally. So I stayed at home. After taking a bit of rest I felt much better and started to work on the PHP course. In the PHP course I fixed the problem yesterday with the file directions. And I started to add 403 and 404 error pages. I finished the lesson and to start a new one would take too long, so I fixed some bugs and improved the code a bit.
