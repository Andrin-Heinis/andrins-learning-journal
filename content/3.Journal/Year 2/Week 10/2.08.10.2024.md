Today we had an governance meeting in the morning, and I got chosen for a new role, and it is that role where you have to share your screen to the meeting and also you have to make notes and so on. This role is called Secretary. In the afternoon we had a tactical meeting and there I had my first job as secretary. For the first time I would say I did it well. Next time I will do it better, because now I know what my “fails” were.
