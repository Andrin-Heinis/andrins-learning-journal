After the daily with Trent and the daily with the Migros squad, I spent some time updating my Zebra timesheets and my learning journal. The rest of the day was dedicated to bug fixes for EKW-3213 and EKW-3215. I changed some variable names in EKW-3212 and added new recruiter data like name, phoneWork, and LinkedIn info to EKW-3215. Also I worked a lot in GraphQL Explorer to test things out.
