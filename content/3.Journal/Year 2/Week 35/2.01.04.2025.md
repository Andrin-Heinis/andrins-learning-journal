After the daily, I joined the Sprint for Migros Karriere, which gave us an overview of the current project status and some new tasks to focus on. Then I continued fixing bugs related to EKW-3212 and EKW-3213 and worked on recruiter data queries for EKW-3215. At some point, I had to revert and re-merge the feature branch job-ad profile, which went smoothly. I ended the day with updating my learning journal.
