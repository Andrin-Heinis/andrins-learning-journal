In the morning I worked intensively on EKW-3212, EKW-3213, and EKW-3215, mostly inside GraphQL Explorer to test queries and investigate how to find the required data. I committed several changes, including deleting false files from a merge, adding new node fields, and merging branches. In the afternoon I had another sync and later updated my journal and timesheet. The day was focused but productive, and I managed to finish more than I expected.
