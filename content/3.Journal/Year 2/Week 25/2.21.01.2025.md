I started with my daily with Trent as usual. Later, I attended a Liip Talk about Web Sustainability Guidelines and an assessment platform presented by Nicolas Lanthemann, which gave some interesting insights into sustainable web practices. After that, I worked on refining the Natourli presentation, focusing on design improvements and the technical approach. The rest of the day was spent continuing Composer installations on various Drupal projects, including Pharmasuisse, PostDoc, Publica, and SHKB.
