I spent most of the day working on installing my composer plugging on multiple Drupal projects, including gh, mfg, ORIS, and PHSG. It was similar to the previous setups, but each project had its own small issues that needed fixing. Some error messages were new, so I had to do some troubleshooting to find the right solutions. It didnâ€™t take that long as expected, but in the end, everything was successfully installed and running smoothly.
