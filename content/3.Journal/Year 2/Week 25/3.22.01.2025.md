After the daily together with Trent, I worked on updating the Zebra timesheets and making sure my learning journal was up to date. It took some time to check and correct the entries, but everything was organized in the end. The rest of the day was focused on finishing the Composer installations for every remaining Drupal project. I went through the last batch, verifying that everything was set up correctly. However, some projects still had issues and didnâ€™t work properly, so I had to exclude them from the final installation. Debugging these problems will likely take more time, but at least most of the work is done now.
