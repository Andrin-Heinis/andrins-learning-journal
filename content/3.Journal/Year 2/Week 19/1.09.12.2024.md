I started with my daily. After that, I spent 4 hours working on the Commerce Order anonymizer module, where I focused on refining the logic and testing the implementation to ensure it worked correctly. Later, I dedicated 3.75 hours to my PHP project, improving functionality and cleaning up the code to enhance performance and readability. It was a productive day filled with development and problem-solving.
