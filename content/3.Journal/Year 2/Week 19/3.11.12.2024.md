I started my daily with Trent as usual. After that, I spent 5 hours learning how Composer and patches work, focusing on managing dependencies and applying fixes effectively. Later, I continued my PHP project for 2 hours, adding new features and cleaning up the code. To end the day, I worked 0.75 hours on the Composer risky-patch-detector, learning how to identify and handle unstable patches. It was a productive day with lots of hands-on learning.
