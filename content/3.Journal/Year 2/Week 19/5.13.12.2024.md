In English, I did the final preparations for my presentation, ensuring everything was ready to go. In Language and Communication, I continued working on the project “Meine Gemeinde,” completing chapters 2.4 and 2.5, which focused on organization, politics, and my personal opinion. I also updated the work log and ensured the bibliography was current. In Politics, I supported the same project work, making good progress overall. It was a day of polishing and wrapping up tasks.
