In English, we prepared our presentations, and my topic was “Minecraft.” In Language and Communication, I continued working on the documentation for “Meine Heimat,” where I added facts about the municipality, history, and a specific work. I also formatted the document, added page numbers, completed the title page, and finished the introduction along with section 2.1. In Politics, I continued working on the same documentation, making further progress.
