I finished the Zoo App design and made the buttons functional so they can be used properly. In Modul 320, I continued preparing for the Object-Oriented Programming exam, focusing on associations. In Modul 426, I worked on the grade management website and completed the registration popup. For Modul 346, I finished the first task of KN03, where I set up an Ubuntu machine and successfully connected it to my Amazon Cloud Service instance. In Mathematics, I continued working on Pythagoras, practicing more exercises.
