I started with my daily together with Trent as usual. After that, I spent 1.25 hours writing and sending feedback emails to the Schnuppernden, summarizing their work and giving them tips for improvement. Then, I worked 1.25 hours on anonymizing order data, making sure sensitive information was properly removed. The biggest part of my day was my PHP project, where I spent 5.25 hours improving and optimizing different parts of the code. Later, I repeated Part 4 of the PHP course for 5 hours to strengthen my understanding and compare it with my project. It was a long but productive coding day.
