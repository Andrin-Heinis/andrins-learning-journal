My goal today was to finish the gallery component. To do that, I had to complete the ticket for the slider component. That was the ticket with the test. I asked Noah for help. Together, we accomplished quite a bit, but unfortunately, we didn't reach our goal. We also tried to fix the warnings that came up during Lint debugging, so we decided to simply ignore them. That worked, but we weren't entirely satisfied in the end.
