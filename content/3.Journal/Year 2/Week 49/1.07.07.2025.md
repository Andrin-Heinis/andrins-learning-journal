Today's goal was to fix all the bugs found in the merge requests and then move on to ticket AOZ-05. Unfortunately, I didn't get that far. I had to do a lot of work in ticket AOZ-33. For example, I had to create a new component for the slider. To do this, I had to learn a new way of testing. This type of test is called a snapshot. This test takes a screenshot of the website as it should look in the end, and then you can work on the component without having to worry too much about it looking different in the end. I think that's brilliant, but what I don't find so brilliant is setting up the test. It looks extremely simple, but it isn't.
