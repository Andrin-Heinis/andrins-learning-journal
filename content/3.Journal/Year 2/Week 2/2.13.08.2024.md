Today, I started a Vue course. Itâ€™s really fun and interesting! Later, John came to the office, and we fixed the problems. Somehow, the database got corrupted, so we had to set it up again. He showed me two useful commands:

**drush sql-dump > andrin.sql** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to create a backup, which I now have.

**drush sqlc < andrin.sql** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to restore the backup I once created.

**ls** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to see if I already have backups.

I think I'll be using these commands often in the future. After that, I began working on the page because I wanted to finish the design before continuing with the course. I also added the Journal Entry logo to make the webpage look better.
