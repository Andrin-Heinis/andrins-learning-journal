Today, I worked on the homepage of the Zoo app for Modul 322, designing everything from a blank page to adding all the images and icons – it turned out looking really cool. For Modul 320, I prepared for the upcoming exam on classes and objects. In Modul 426, I continued building the frontend for the grade management website. For Modul 346, I worked on Amazon Cloud Services, but my progress was a bit slow. In math, I’m also getting ready for a test next week.
