Recently, I’ve been revisiting the basics in my PHP course daily, focusing on part I to fully understand a specific issue. It’s slow but rewarding as I make progress. Today, I challenged myself to set up Platform.sh on my own, aiming to update the database and connect it to my starter kit project. After several tries, I couldn’t get it to work solo, so I teamed up with Trent, and we managed to set it up together. It felt like a win, even if it needed some teamwork. But still it needs a lot of work to do.
