In English, we had a fun discussion about Halloween, exploring its origins and learning how the traditions began. It was fascinating to see how Halloween has evolved and to understand the reasons behind some customs we still see today. In Language and Communication, I spoke with Ms. Müller about my grade on my poster, "My Country." We also started a new project where we created our own political party, which was both exciting and challenging, as it made us think about the values and goals we’d want to stand for. For next week, we need to prepare a presentation to introduce our party, share our vision, and explain each category we’ve chosen. This will help us practice organizing and presenting our ideas clearly. In Social Studies, I couldn’t attend class because I had to go to the hospital for an eye check, so I missed out that lesson.
