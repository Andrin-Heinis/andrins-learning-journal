I spent 0.25 hours on my daily tasks with Trent to keep our workflow consistent and ensure we're aligned. Then I dedicated around 1.5 hours to setting up the hosting, which involved some detailed configuration steps and provided valuable insights as I connected different parts of the project to the hosting environment. The biggest task of the day was setting up MySQL for PHP, which took a solid 6.25 hours. It was challenging and at times frustrating, but by the end, I felt good. Working on part III of the project alongside the MySQL setup gave me a deep dive into database connections, configurations, and troubleshooting, which are essential skills for backend development. While it was tough, the experience was worthwhile and definitely boosted my confidence in handling similar tasks in the future.
