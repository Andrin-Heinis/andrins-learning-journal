I started with a new ticket: AOZ-37. I had to create a new component to add news to the news list. I started by creating a new paragraph. I had a lot of problems doing that. But I got help and was able to solve everything. Later that afternoon, I participated in a Liip talk. It was about "How do I know I grow?" It was very interesting. We also had a governance meeting today. I was given a new role: Facilitator. And after that meeting, I wrote today's diary entry.
