​​I started with my daily as usual. Then, I had a short photo shooting session for profile pictures. After that, I participated in the Apprentice ZH tactical meeting for 30 minutes, followed by a regular exchange with other apprentices to discuss progress and experiences. Later, I spent 2 hours continuing work on the anonymization ticket, making adjustments based on feedback. After that, I worked 3.5 hours on hosting, improving the setup and solving some issues. To end the day, I spent 1 hour on my PHP course, going through new concepts and refining my skills.
