I spent 5 hours working on my PHP project, refining features and optimizing the code to improve performance. I also fixed a few small bugs that were affecting functionality and tested different solutions to make the project more stable. Later, I spent 3 hours on hosting, adjusting the setup and ensuring that everything was running smoothly. I also checked for any performance issues and made small improvements where needed. It was a productive day with a good mix of debugging and optimization.
