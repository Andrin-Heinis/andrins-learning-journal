I spent 6 hours on my PHP course, starting Part 5 and trying out different concepts by myself. This part focused on new techniques, and I experimented with some practical examples to understand them better. Later, I worked for 2 hours on the anonymization ticket, refining some details and making sure everything was implemented correctly.
