My main goal today was to finish the ticket EKW-3212 where I was working for a long time. I had to do some last changes with the tailwind css and some error fixes. After that I was ready to merge the test branch into that ticket. There were some errors but only tiny ones. All in one looked great and I was happy that everything worked perfectly. Also I synced together with Manuel to update him about the upcoming Schnuppertag. And then I went to the Tactical and after that I did my daily check I forgot to do in the morning.
