Today I had a school day with two tests, first in GS about Versicherungen II and later in SK where it was all about Wortschatz. We went through Sachversicherungen and compared Grundversicherungen with Zusatzversicherungen. There was also a Merkblatt about the Krankenkasse which helped to understand it better. At the end I repeated some insurance vocabulary to be more prepared.
