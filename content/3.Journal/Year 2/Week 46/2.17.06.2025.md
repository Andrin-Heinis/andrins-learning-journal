I started on the gallery ticket today. I created a to-do list for the ticket and then I got started. I copied an existing paragraph and adjusted the name, etc. I did the same thing in the backend; I created a new paragraph there. Then I started inserting the image and text in the frontend. Later that afternoon, I prepared for the sprint review and then participated in it. Then I wrote the journal, and that was it for the day.
