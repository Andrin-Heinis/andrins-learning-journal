I had a lot to do at school at the moment, as we were in the final sprint. There were a lot of projects to complete, which was quite stressful, but also exciting. In these projects, we worked with Docker and Camunda, among other things. I found Docker particularly interesting because it allows you to easily containerize entire environments. Camunda was a bit more complex at first, but I quickly understood how to model business processes with it. I also had a math test today, which I thankfully did very well. I'm sure I'll get a good grade, which I'm happy about, especially now when so much is happening at once.
