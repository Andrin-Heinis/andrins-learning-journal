When I got to the office, I started checking to see if there were any new applicants. Unfortunately, there weren't. So we had to cancel the trial day. Otherwise, I continued working on the AOZ-37. I finished the mobile design and the desktop design at the same time. I finished the ticket. That's a new personal record for finishing a ticket within three days. Apart from that, I did a lot of administrative work, like writing rejection emails for the applicants from the trial day. There was also an exciting topic about the Liip at lunchtime (with tasty pizza served ðŸ˜‹), and before going home, I worked on the journal.
