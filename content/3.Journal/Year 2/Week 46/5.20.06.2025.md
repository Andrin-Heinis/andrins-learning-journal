Today we had English, and we had a lot to discuss because we saw our English teacher for the last time before the holidays. We actually had a presentation to give, but we didn't get around to it. We decided to do a book report. Later we had politics. We had a test: we had to write a five-page essay about marriage and divorce. And right after that, we had to describe a picture or write an essay about a day with an AI friend. I think I did very well in both. It was a tiring day, but also a productive one.
