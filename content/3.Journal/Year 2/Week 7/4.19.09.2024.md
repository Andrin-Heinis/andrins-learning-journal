Today, I presented my report on the three most commonly used Scrum tools. It went well, and I received a grade of 5. Later, we had an object-oriented programming class, and I made significant progress, completing 3-4 tasks from my to-do list. We also delved further into Scrum and learned more about sprints. In addition, we had a session on cloud systems, where I had to rebuild my web server due to a technical issue.
