I started my daily with Trent as usual. After that, I had a quick daily for Migros before updating my Zebra timesheets and working on my journal. I spent some time ensuring that all entries were correctly logged and organized. The biggest task of the day was fixing a broken pipeline in the learning-journal project, which turned out to be trickier than expected. In the end I couldnâ€™t fix the error. (I tried so hard and got so far. But in the end, it doesn't even matter).
