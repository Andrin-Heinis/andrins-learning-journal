We started with a recap of ERD and ERM, going over key concepts like entity relationships, attributes, and how to model associations such as 1:1, 1:c, and 1:m. After that, we moved on to container virtualization, where we compared containers with virtual machines and learned when to use each. We also installed Docker Desktop and explored its basic functions. Later, we revisited number systems, practicing conversions between different formats like hexadecimal to binary, which was a good refresher.
