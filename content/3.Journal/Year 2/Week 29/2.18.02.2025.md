I started my daily with Trent as usual. After that, I had a Scrum introduction session, where we went over the basics and structure of Scrum workflows and how scrum works in the Migros project. The majority of my day was then spent updating my journal, making sure everything was documented. Towards the end of the day, I worked on fixing broken merge requests across various Drupal projects, continuing from the issues I tackled yesterday.
