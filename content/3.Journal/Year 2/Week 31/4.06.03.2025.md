In school, I continued working on implementing databases using Docker with MariaDB and phpMyAdmin. I focused on transforming the zoo data model into a real database and reviewed the solution together with the class. Afterwards, I read the theory section on ER models and then worked on the second ERM task, which involved creating the ‘bistro_db’ database with four tables and testing SQL commands. At the end of the day, I started reading a short introduction on the differences between SQL and NoSQL.
