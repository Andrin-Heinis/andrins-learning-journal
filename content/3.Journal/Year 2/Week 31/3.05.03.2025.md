I started with a short session to update Zebra timesheets and finish the journal entry. After that, I had a short knowledge-sharing session with Hasan, where he explained how to read PHP error messages more effectively and how to locate errors in the code quicker. Then I continued working on Trufflehog, looking for a proper way to use it in our setup. In the afternoon, I focused on EKW-3213 and spent some time setting icons and formatting everything to make it consistent and clean.
