I started with my daily with Trent as usual and shortly after joined the Migros Karriere daily with Sergio. We had a full onboarding block for Migros, where I got introduced to their processes and projects. It helped me understand the background of what Iâ€™ll be working on. Then I had a short tactical session with the apprentice group. In the afternoon, I spent several hours on the Migros redesign (EKW-3212), going over current layouts and making some first suggestions.
