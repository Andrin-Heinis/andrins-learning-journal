I started with English in the morning. After that, we began a new topic about colour systems, like hexadecimal and RGB. We learned how colours are represented with numbers and how to convert between hex codes and RGB values. During the day, I also worked on implementing a database using Docker with MariaDB and phpMyAdmin. I had to set up a Zoo database model and apply what I learned from the ERM theory. I also read some pages from the ERM theory PDF to better understand how entity relationships work.
