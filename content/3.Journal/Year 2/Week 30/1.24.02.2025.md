I started with the daily with Trent as usual. After that, we had a short sync for the Migros Karriere daily, then I worked on fixing a Composer plugin merge request which was broken and needed adjustments. Later in the day, I prepared for the Schnuppertag. In the afternoon, I went to the UX-Day, where we got to see some cool design concepts and talks. It was a cool day.
