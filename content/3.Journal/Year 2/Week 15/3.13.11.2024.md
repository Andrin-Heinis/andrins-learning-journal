I started the day with a 15-minute daily session together with Trent to plan and align our tasks for the day. After that, I spent 2 hours working on the Schnuppertag project, refining the structure and preparing everything for the upcoming presentation. Then, I spent 1 hour finishing the hosting setup, ensuring that everything is running smoothly and all configurations are correct. For the rest of the day, about 4.75 hours, I focused on the PHP course and worked on my own PHP project to reinforce and better understand the concepts covered in the course. It was a well-balanced day of planning, project work, and skill development.
