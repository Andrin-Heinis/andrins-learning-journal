I started the day with a 15-minute daily session together with Trent to plan and align our tasks for the day. For the rest of the day, around 6.75 hours, I focused on improving my CSS skills by playing an interactive game on [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/#de) to practice and deepen my understanding of flexbox concepts. Additionally, I revisited Part I of the PHP course, concentrating on arrays and their practical use cases. It was a productive day of teamwork and skill-building.
