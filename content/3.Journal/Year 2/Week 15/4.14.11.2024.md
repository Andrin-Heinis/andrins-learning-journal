In Modul 322, I attempted to make the buttons interactive in Figma, but it didn’t work as I had hoped, so I’ll need to revisit this. In Modul 320, I continued working on tasks related to object-oriented programming. For Modul 426, I finished the login page and ensured its design matched the style of the other components. In Modul 346, I made progress with Amazon Web Service tasks and successfully completed the second part. In Mathematik, I continued solving tasks related to Pythagoras, further building my understanding of the topic.
