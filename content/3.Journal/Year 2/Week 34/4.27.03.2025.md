Today was a full school day focused entirely on NoSQL Databases and Docker basics. In the morning, I worked on the NoSQL research task. My part was to look into "document-oriented” and the “in memory" databases and summarize the key points. We also created a small poster to present the differences between key-value, graph-based, and document-oriented databases. Later, we continued with exercises for the LB next week. In the afternoon, I started reading about Docker CLI commands and how to handle containers, images, and volumes. It was quite a bit of theory, but I feel more confident now about the basics of both NoSQL and Docker.
