Today I was at school until 16:00. We got an announcement about an upcoming written exam on NoSQL basics, JSON and data models where weâ€™ll be allowed to use one A4 cheat sheet. After that we practised developing data models with MongoDB, importing and exporting JSON using Mongo Express and MongoCompass, and tried adding data through Docker Compose.
