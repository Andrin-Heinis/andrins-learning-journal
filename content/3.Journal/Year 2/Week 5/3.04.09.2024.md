Today I continued the Vue 3 course and got pretty far. I completed one and a half parts of the course, which brought me a lot closer to completing the whole course. The speed at which the content is conveyed is very fast and I had to really concentrate to understand everything. The sections that dealt with implementing more complex functions were particularly challenging. I noticed that I had to pause and rewind the video a lot to get all the details. But I'm enjoying it because I really feel like I'm learning something that I can use well later.
