Today was a snow day at school, so instead of regular classes, we had an outdoor activity. I went hiking, enjoying the fresh snow and the winter atmosphere. The trail was a bit challenging at times, but the view at the top made it worth it. It was a nice change from the usual school routine, and the cold air felt refreshing.
