I had my presentation about "Meine Gemeinde" today, but I misunderstood what we had to do. Instead of just presenting my own project, I prepared for the entire topic, which made it a bit harder. Even though I was not completely ready for what they expected, it still went okay. After that, we had a short fitness session where we did some exercises before the rest of the class continued with their presentations. It was interesting to see how others worked on their projects and how different their approaches were.
