In English, we chose a topic for our presentations on 20.12.2024 and did some exercises on past, present, and continuous tenses. In Language and Communication, we started with “Meine Gemeinde,” which we will continue working on later. In Politics, we also had fitness, and after fitness we continued working on our new project. In the future we will work on “Meine Gemeinde” in both Politics and Language and Communication.
