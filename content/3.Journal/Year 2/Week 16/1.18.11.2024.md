I started the day with a 15-minute daily session together with Trent to align our tasks and priorities. After that, I spent 4.25 hours working on my PHP course, focusing on building my own PHP project to better understand and apply the concepts I’ve learned. In the afternoon, I attended the UX Day in Zürich, which lasted 3.5 hours. During the UX Day, we focused on how people look at websites and which areas they tend to ignore. We learned about visual hierarchies and how to use design elements effectively to guide users’ attention. It was interesting to analyze which parts of a webpage are noticed first and how to use these areas for important content. Another key topic was how visual aids can improve user guidance and make navigation more intuitive. In groups, we discussed what design choices are effective for enhancing the user experience. At the end of the session, we summarized the key points and talked about how to apply them to our own designs.
