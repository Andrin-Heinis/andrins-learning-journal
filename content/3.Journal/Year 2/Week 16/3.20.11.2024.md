I started with my daily as usual. After that, I worked 1 hour on anonymizing order data. Then, I spent 4 hours on hosting, mainly completing the .sh files. I had to add my API keys and set the correct address for my website. Later, I worked 2.75 hours on my PHP project, where I handled images. There were too many images, which caused the website to lag, so I optimized everything by deleting unnecessary files and improving performance.
