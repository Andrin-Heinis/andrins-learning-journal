Today I completed a lot of small tickets, mostly fixing bugs in the individual components. I fixed bugs in the teaser, gallery, IFrameJob, and other components. Next, I had to change the logo on the website, which required me to convert an svg to a favicon.ico. I then inserted that, and I was done. After that, I had to spend about three hours fixing TypeScript errors.
