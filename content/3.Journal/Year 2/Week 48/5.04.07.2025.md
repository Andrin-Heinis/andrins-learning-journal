Today I went to an exhibition with my class. It was about health. I learned a lot. I also had to find a topic for my project next semester. The exhibition also had screens with people on them. These people have different illnesses. I found someone there who was also deaf, like me. That was a funny coincidence. I continued looking into other topics and decided on antibiotics for my project.
