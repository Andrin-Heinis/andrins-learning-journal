Today, I started with the tasks Jens assigned to me, along with the tasks from yesterday. I made good progress until Jens came to check on my work and showed me the correct approach. I had mistakenly created a new page instead of a new content type. Once I began working on the correct task, everything started to make sense. I spent time testing all the Paragraphs and other elements to understand how they function. I also explored the different features and components to get a better understanding of how they all fit together. By the end of the day, I felt much more comfortable with the workflow and the tools.
