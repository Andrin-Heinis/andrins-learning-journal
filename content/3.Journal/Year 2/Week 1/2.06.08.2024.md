In the morning, I finished reading the rest of the Best Practices. Later, I had a meeting where I met Jonathan, who is knowledgeable about setting up Lando and Docker on a Windows computer. Together, we worked on diagnosing and fixing the issues. After about an hour and a half, we were able to resolve them. Following that, I continued reading through the Best Practices until Jens and I went to a meeting room, where he explained how the Starterkit works. Afterward, I began exploring the Starterkit on my own to gain a better understanding. In the afternoon, Severin, Jana, and I went to a meeting room to discuss and sign the rules and guidelines. Right after that, my day was over.
