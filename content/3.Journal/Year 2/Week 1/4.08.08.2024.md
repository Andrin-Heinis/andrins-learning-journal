This morning, I had a meeting with Remo, where he explained the Drupal Circle to me and outlined what I can expect to see there. It sounds fascinating! After our meeting, I continued working through the tasks on my onboarding list. I spent some time finalizing the content type for my journal page, which went smoothly and helped me learn a lot. In the afternoon, I attended a meeting in the Drupal Circle. It was great to meet everyone, and I received many warm "Welcome to Liip!" messages. During the meeting, we discussed our recent activities, upcoming tasks, and any challenges we're facing. Later, Jens and I rented a meeting room to finish setting up my site in Starterkit. After about ten minutes, everything was up and running, and I could see the content I had entered earlier.
