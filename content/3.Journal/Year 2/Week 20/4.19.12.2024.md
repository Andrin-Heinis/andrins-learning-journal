In Modul 322, I presented my zoo app design, which went well, and I received positive feedback on the functionality and layout. In Modul 320, I continued working on the Cluedo game, focusing on refining the mechanics. For Modul 426, I helped a classmate connect the frontend I created to the backend, troubleshooting and ensuring a smooth integration. In Modul 346, I completed tasks 2 and 3 of KN03, finalizing the required implementations. In Mathematics, we had a test on Pythagoras, which allowed me to apply the concepts I had practiced.
