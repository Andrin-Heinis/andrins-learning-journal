I started with my daily with Trent as usual. After that, I spent 1 hour checking the patch-risk-detector for Composer, ensuring everything was functioning as expected. Then, I participated in a Natourli SaaS review for 1 hour, analyzing the tools and their alignment with the projectâ€™s needs. Later, I spent 3.5 hours continuing and finishing the risk-patch-detector for Composer, completing the remaining features and finalizing the implementation. Afterward, I took 1.25 hours to update my timesheets and journal entries, ensuring all my work was properly recorded. To end the day, I worked 2 hours on my PHP course, practicing advanced concepts and applying them to small tasks.
