Next week we had to give a presentation on a topic. I picked Scrum tools as my theme. I did this presentation at school and practiced it again at home. In the second lesson I had object-oriented programming. That was rather boring in this lesson because I only had to enter data instead of actually programming because there was already a template. In the third lesson we looked at Scrum tools as a module and we talked and worked with sprints. And in the fourth lesson we talked about cloud servers and systems. I had to host my own web server. That worked more or less well.
