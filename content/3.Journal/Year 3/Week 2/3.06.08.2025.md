Today, my goal was to finish the ticket. I started with a rollback, since I hadn't made any progress yesterday. Then I looked at the code Leo created for this issue. It was easy to understand, but it was located in about five different files. This made it a bit difficult to understand everything, and at the end of the day, I didn't finish the ticket, but I'm pretty sure I'll be able to do it tomorrow. :)
