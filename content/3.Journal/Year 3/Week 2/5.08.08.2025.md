Today I worked on a tutorial that Leo sent me yesterday. It was very simple at first, and I could follow along easily, but over time it became a bit more complicated, and I had trouble following everything. At some point, I gave up, or rather, I wanted to take a short break, and continued building my website where I publish my journal. But I made so much progress that I forgot about the tutorial. The website is now accessible at andrins-learning-journal.ch.
