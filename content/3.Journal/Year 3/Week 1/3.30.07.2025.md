I had to finish the SVG today. It took about three hours, but I finally got it done. After giving each canton the correct ID, I finally started on the code. Honestly, the code part was much easier than fixing the damn SVG. To redirect the user to the correct link, I had to insert the ID from the SVG into this link:
`/angebote?canton=${key}`
And this worked very well. Later, together with David we decided on a hover color. We came to the color black, because it's the one we can see the best.
