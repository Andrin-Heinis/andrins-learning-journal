Today I finished setting up the frontend, as I hadn't quite finished it yesterday. After restarting my laptop, it finally worked. With Boris's help, I was able to complete the setup. There was a missing .env file that had been created incorrectly. Once everything was working, Boris told me to make the map interactive. Clicking on a canton should redirect you to the correct page. However, I had to disassemble and reassemble the entire SVG to understand how it worked. Creating the SVG took about four hours.
