I started with my daily with Trent as usual. After that, I worked for 5 hours on the ticket to anonymize order data. The reason it took so long was that I finally finished the feature, making sure everything worked correctly. Later, I spent 1 hour setting up hosting by myself, troubleshooting some minor issues along the way. At the end of the day, I continued my PHP course for 1.75 hours, working on my project and improving some parts of the code.
