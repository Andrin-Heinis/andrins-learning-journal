Today I started with the AOZxLiip daily. After that I spent almost the entire day working on AOZ-27 where I finished coding the mobile design for the teaser component. I made sure all breakpoints look clean and adjusted some small layout issues. Later I continued updating my journal so all progress and details stay properly tracked.
