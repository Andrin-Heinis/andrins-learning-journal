Today, Trent and I had our daily meeting where we discussed my tasks and what needed to be done next. Later in the day, we worked together on a ticket for bs.ch. We set up the basics for a new newsletter page, building the foundation and starting to add some initial content. It was a productive day, and it felt good to make solid progress on the bs.ch project again.
