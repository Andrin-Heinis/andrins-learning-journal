Unfortunately, I missed breakfast today, which made for a bit of a rough start. Despite that, I attended the Drupal Governance meeting, which covered the latest updates and policies in the Drupal ecosystem. The meeting was informative, and it was interesting to see how governance operates within Drupal. After the meeting, I spent the rest of the day working on the PHP course, diving into some more complex topics. It was a good day for deepening my understanding of PHP.
