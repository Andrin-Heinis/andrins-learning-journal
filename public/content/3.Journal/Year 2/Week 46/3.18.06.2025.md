Today, Nah and I discussed a few things because it turned out yesterday that I had programmed the wrong design. But that's okay, because it was mainly just the design that was wrong. I worked on the design until lunchtime, and in the afternoon I worked on the button. Today I also participated in the tactical. It was my first tactical in my new role as facilitator. I think everyone noticed that I was very nervous ðŸ˜…. But I think I led the meeting well.
