Today we had an english exam and it was easy but I didn’t see a lot of trapt, that's why I got a five instead of a six. But it doesn’t bother me because I wasn’t prepared and still got an ok mark. It was a surprise exam by the way. Also I finished my poster about how our voting system works. After finishing it I found some mistakes, but overall it was fine.
