We started working on the website "School - Planner" last week, but mostly focused on small things like setting up GitHub and organizing the basics. Today, we made real progress by planning out the next steps, which was fun because we did it as a team. We also made a schedule so that we know exactly what needs to be done by when.
Later on, we worked more with cloud servers, but I didnâ€™t find that part as interesting. It felt a bit dry compared to the planning process, which I enjoyed more.
