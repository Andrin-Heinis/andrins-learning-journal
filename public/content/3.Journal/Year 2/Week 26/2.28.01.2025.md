I started with my daily with Trent as usual. After that, I had a short session with Naniko to get to know each other. Later, I joined the Migros Karriere daily with Sergio and the others from the Migros squad, where I also met Andras, a new member too next to me. The main part of the day was focused on Sprint 25.1 review, retro, and planning for Sprint 25.2. I also spent some time checking all reviews related to the risky-patch-composer. Towards the end of the day, I participated in an apprentice tactical meeting before finishing up by fixing patches for the pipeline in every Drupal project.
