In the first lesson we had english. We talked about how to improve the classroom to work better in school. I like it that we are talking only in English, because that helps me a lot by learning english. After that English lesson I went to my language and communication class. We listened to a presentation about Bio Suisse. It was kinda interesting, even if I already know most of it. After that we had the company class. We talked about the US-Votes and who is getting voted now and so on. It was very interesting, because the last time I heard about US-votes was 4 years ago, because then it was the last time someone got voted in the USA. After that lesson my day was over.
