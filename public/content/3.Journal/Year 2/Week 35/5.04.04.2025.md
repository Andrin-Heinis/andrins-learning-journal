We had English today, and we talked about personalities. We made a little game out of it where we had to quickly name a person everyone knew before the "bomb exploded," and then we had to pass the bomb on. After a while, the bomb exploded, and then we lost. Later, we had GS and SK. We had an exam in both subjects. In SK, I had to write a business letter. I had to write a letter to a home contents insurance company. I got a good grade for that. And in GS, I had to fill out a test that was more than six pages long. It covered all kinds of insurance, which insurance policies apply when, etc. This test went well, too.
