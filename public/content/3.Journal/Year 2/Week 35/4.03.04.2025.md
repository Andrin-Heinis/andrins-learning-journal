We continued working on Module 165 (Using NoSQL Databases) at school. We had to complete various assignments covering database types such as key-value, column-based, graph databases, object-oriented, document-oriented, and in-memory. My favorite database used to be the JSON database. Now, my perspective has changed, and I’m beginning to understand why there are different types of databases. In the afternoon, we had an exam on Docker commands. Unfortunately, it didn’t go very well.
