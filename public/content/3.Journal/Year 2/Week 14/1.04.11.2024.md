I started the day by spending an hour updating DDEV on my own. It wasnâ€™t as straightforward as I thought, and I ran into a few small issues. But figuring out how to fix them on my own gave me a better understanding of how DDEV works and how to set up a smooth development environment. The rest of the day, about 7 hours, I spent working on Part III of the PHP course. This section focused on more advanced topics like connecting to databases, creating dynamic web pages, and handling user input safely. I also worked on small practice projects to apply what I had learned, which helped me understand the material better.
