I started the day by spending 2 hours fixing the Starterkit, as the version needed an update. I troubleshooted the issues, applied the necessary changes, and ensured everything worked correctly. In the afternoon, I made the Apprentice ZH tactical ready And there we talked about our tasks. After that, I continued Part III of the PHP course, working on advanced topics like database queries, performance optimization, and security, along with practical exercises to apply what I learned. It was a well-balanced day of problem-solving, teamwork, and learning.
