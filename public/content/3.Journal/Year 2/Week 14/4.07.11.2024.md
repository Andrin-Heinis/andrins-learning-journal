I finished all pages for the zoo mobile app in Modul 322 and now need to activate the buttons for navigation between pages. In Modul 320, I continued working on object-oriented programming. For Modul 426, I completed the popup for entering a new mark and started working on the login popup. In Modul 346, I continued with tasks in Amazon Web Services but accidentally forgot to make a journal entry earlier. In Math, I got my mark back, and I was a bit annoyed, because of the mark. It was a 3.6. The reason why I got that mark was because the first test went well, where I got a 5.3. And in the second test I got extremely nervous because I thought it would be extra hard. And then I made simple mistakes. The next theme is Pythagoras.
