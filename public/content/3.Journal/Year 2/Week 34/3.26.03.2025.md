After the daily with Trent, I joined the Migros daily, where we briefly discussed ongoing topics. Then I worked on syncing tasks and made sure everyone had the latest updates. I spent a large part of the day developing for tickets EKW-3212 and EKW-3215. I added new components and committed all the necessary files, merged different branches to compare if everything is working together, and carefully cleaned up the code to ensure consistency. After all that was done, I took time to continue my journal to reflect the work I had done.
