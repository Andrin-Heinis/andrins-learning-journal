Today I was working on the tickets EKW-3212 and EKW-3213. In 3212 I wasnâ€™t satisfied with the css of the three dots. I wanted to get the three dots in the exact middle of the first line. And also I needed to change the code a bit so it works together with the data from the backend. Also I had some problems with the rendering of the three icons. Because for some reason only one of them was rendered. I managed to see all three of the icons at the same time by putting all of them in a separate container.
