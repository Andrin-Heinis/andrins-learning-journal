I started with my daily like everyday. After that, I joined the migros daily together with the migros squad. Then, I participated in a sync meeting with Stefan, we looked at my code and solved some issues I couldn’t fix by myself. Then I worked a long time on the tickets. In EKW-3212 I did the most work. There I had to formatt the text better. For me that was a big challenge, because I wasn’t familiar with tailwind at all, even when I finished a small course for tailwind. In the afternoon Jürg, Manuel, Noah and I, we planned and discussed some topics for the apprenticeship in the future. And then everything happened fast. I had to print out some Schnupperbewerbungen for the upcoming Schnuppertag. After that we had a tactical meeting. After that I had a short exchange with Elena and then I continued writing my journal.
