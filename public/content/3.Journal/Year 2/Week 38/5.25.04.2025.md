Today I started with the AOZxLiip daily and then had a sync with Jens, Noah and Andrin to go over the current status and next steps for AOZ. After that I worked the whole day on AOZ-27 and pushed the teaser component even further. I did lots of fine-tuning on the layout and styles, tested different use cases and made sure everything was responsive and ready for review. It felt really good to see how polished itâ€™s becoming.
