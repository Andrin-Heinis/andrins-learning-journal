Today I started with the AOZxLiip daily and then had a quick sync with Jan to clarify a few open points for my current tasks. After that I worked on Zebra timesheets and updated my journal so everything stays properly documented. I spent the rest of the day working on AOZ-27, continued building the Row Teaser Component and checked that everything matched the design specs. I managed to move it quite a bit forward today.
