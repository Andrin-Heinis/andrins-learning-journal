I started with English in the morning as usual. We corrected the business letter by numbering the errors and also practiced vocabulary. After the break, I had GS, where we talked about the 3-pillar system and the basic concept behind it. It was quite interesting to see how insurance is structured in Switzerland. Later in SK, I looked at recent updates about the Swiss Federal Council. In the afternoon, I had a short sports lesson where I played ping pong, which was a fun change from the usual schedule.
