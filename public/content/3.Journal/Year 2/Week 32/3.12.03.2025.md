I started the day with the usual daily and the Migros Karriere daily. After that, I spent some time updating Zebra Timesheets and my journal entry. Most of my day, however, went into working on ticket EKW-3212. I focused on fixing the dots, which were not displaying in the correct row and vertical instead of horizontal. Additionally, I created two containers and adjusted their layout. I also corrected the title and aligned the right container properly. It was a bit repetitive, but the progress was satisfying.
