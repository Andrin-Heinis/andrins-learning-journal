I started with my daily with Trent as usual and then joined the Migros Karriere daily. After that, I participated in the Migros Sync, where we discussed our current progress and priorities. Later, I worked on a pipeline issue that had been causing some problems and managed to fix it. Most of my day was focused on EKW-3212, where I adjusted the hover text and improved some shapes, and also added new code and styling for the section “Was du bewegst”. I also briefly looked into EKW-3213 to continue progress there. Toward the end, I explored Trufflehog to find a way to detect secrets in the history of commits.
