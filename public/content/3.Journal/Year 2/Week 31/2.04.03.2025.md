I started with my daily with Trent as usual. After that, I joined a Migros Sprint Review, Retrospective, and Planning meeting which lasted quite long but was very informative. I also attended the Team and Knowledge Transfer session. During the sync, we talked about what everyone is working on and shared ideas. Later in the day, I joined the Drupal ZH Team Talks. The talks were short presentations by a few people, and I especially enjoyed the live coding session with AI. I ended the day by continuing my work on EKW-3212, fixing the hover text and adjusting the shape of elements.
