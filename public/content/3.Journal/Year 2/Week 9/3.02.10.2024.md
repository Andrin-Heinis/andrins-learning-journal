Today, I studied Lambda Functions. I've used lambda functions in Python before, so the general concept wasn't new to me. However, PHP's way of implementing them has a few nuances that are good to learn. I went back and reviewed this lesson twice to make sure I didnâ€™t miss anything important. Writing anonymous functions was a bit different, but I caught on quickly.
