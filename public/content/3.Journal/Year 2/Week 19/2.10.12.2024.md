I started with my daily together with Trent. After that, I spent 2 hours in a Natourli work session, focusing on planning and discussing progress. Then, I worked 0.75 hours on the ticket to anonymize order data, refining some details. Later, I joined Drupal ZH team talks for 2.75 hours, where we discussed various updates and tasks. I spent 1.5 hours trying to understand and improve the hosting solution for one of the projects. Afterward, I updated my journals for 0.75 hours to ensure everything was properly documented. To wrap up the day, I worked 1 hour on my PHP project, implementing some minor changes.
