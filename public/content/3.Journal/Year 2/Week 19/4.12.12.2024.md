In Modul 322, I prepared a presentation for the Zoo App, making sure it was ready to showcase. In Modul 320, I continued working on the Cluedi game we started three months ago, making good progress on the mechanics. For Modul 426, I focused on fixing bugs and completing the teacher’s point of view on the website. In Modul 346, I finished task 2 of KN03, finalizing all required steps. In Mathematics, I prepared for the Pythagoras assessment, practicing problems to ensure I’m ready. It was a day filled with preparation and finishing touches.
