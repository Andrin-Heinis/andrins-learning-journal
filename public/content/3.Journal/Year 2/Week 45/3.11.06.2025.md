Today I continued with the ticket. I made the paragraph available so that you can now drag this "news" onto the page with Bl√∂kkli Editor. That was very easy because I've done it before. Today I also did a little bit of preparation for the upcoming Schnuppertag. I had to write emails to those who are interested in a Schnuppertag at our office. That went very well, but I don't like doing it because I've made mistakes several times and caused unnecessary confusion. I hope I won't have to do it again next year.
Anyway, today, I attended a meeting where Manuel and Julien gave their IPA and IPW presentations. That was very exciting, and I wrote down a lot of things that I can use for my IPA presentation. And at the end of the day I wrote a journal and entered all the zebra timesheets.
