In the first class today I had to continue working on my Camunda project. I made a lot of progress, although I can’t really remember exactly what I did. In the next class, I worked on my Docker project. I followed a step-by-step tutorial from a PDF to understand everything and to answer the questions from my teacher. I managed to answer most of them correctly. Later, I had maths. We finally switched to a new topic: calculating with percentages and permilles. I’m very good at this topic, so I felt confident.
