Today we had English, and we talked about many different topics, especially about the upcoming BBQ fest that was organized by our English teacher. Later, we had German. We had to answer questions about marriage and divorce, and afterwards we had to describe an image. I think I did very well with that. Then I also had to draw another picture within one minute based on a description I received:
