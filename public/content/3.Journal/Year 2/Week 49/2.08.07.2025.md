Today I worked on the gallery. I tried to make as much progress as possible. When it came to the test, I had to do a lot of research. The problem was that this test didn't match the Vitest. Then I had to figure out how we could solve the problem. Unfortunately, we only solved part of it, but when I tried it later with Noah, we managed it. It wasn't easy at all. At lunchtime, I organized a card tournament. Unfortunately, only six people showed up, but that was okay because we had a lot of fun playing UNO.
