I spent the day at vocational school. In English, I gave my presentation about Minecraft, explaining its history, impact, and why it remains popular. In Language and Communication, I worked on the final parts of the “Meine Gemeinde” project, completing chapters 2.6 and 2.7, writing the conclusion, and making sure everything was properly formatted. I also updated the work log and finalized the bibliography. In Politics, I wrapped up the same project, ensuring all sections were completed and uploaded the final document to OneDrive. But the project is not finished yet. I still have to do my video about that project.
