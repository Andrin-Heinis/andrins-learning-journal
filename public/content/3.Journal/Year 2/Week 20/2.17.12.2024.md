I started with my daily with Trent as usual. After that, I spent 1 hour syncing Natourli tech, ensuring that all updates and configurations were aligned. Then, I joined the Apprentice ZH tactical for 30 minutes, discussing ongoing tasks and priorities. Later, I worked with Noah for 1 hour on a shared task, focusing on collaboration and problem-solving. I spent 3.25 hours rating backend tools for Natourli, analyzing their capabilities and determining the best fit for the project. To end the day, I worked 2.25 hours on my PHP project, implementing new features and refining the existing code.
