I started my daily routine with Trent as usual. After that, I spent 5 hours continuing work on the Composer risky-patch-detector, improving its functionality and testing it further to handle different scenarios. Later, I updated my learning journal for 0.75 hours, making sure all tasks and progress were documented clearly. To wrap up the day, I spent 2.25 hours rating backend tools for Natourli, evaluating their features and suitability for the project. It was a productive mix of coding, documentation, and analysis.
