I had school today, where we finalized our grades and had the report card submission. After school, we had a surprise event, which turned out to be an escape room in Dietlikon called "Exorcist." It was a horror-themed challenge where we had to solve puzzles and escape within the time limit. The atmosphere was eerie, but it was a fun experience, and we managed to escape just in time.
