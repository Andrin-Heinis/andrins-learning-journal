At school, we focused on polymorphism, UML, and method overriding in Modul 320, where we also learned about visibility levels and solved related exercises. In Modul 346, Louis and I worked on Cloud-Init and AWS, dealing with practical tasks, while Lorenzo focused on network security and related configurations. The lessons were structured with a mix of theoretical input and hands-on exercises, making it easier to understand the concepts.
