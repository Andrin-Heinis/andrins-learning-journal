Today I started with the Apprentice daily and afterwards updated my journal to keep all entries complete. Then we had a short AOZ sync to go through the current status. After that I spent the entire day working on AOZ-27 and focused only on writing tests for the teaser component. I created different cases to check how the component behaves with various data inputs and also made sure the styling stays consistent. It took quite some time to cover everything properly but now the tests are much more solid.
