Today I started with the AOZ daily and then joined a two-hour session for AOZxLiip to plan, review and do a retro of the sprints. After that I updated my journal. I spent the rest of the day working on AOZ-27, continued writing more tests for the teaser component and cleaned up some test cases to make sure they run reliably.
