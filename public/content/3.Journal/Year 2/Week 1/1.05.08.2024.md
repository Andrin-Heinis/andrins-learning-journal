Today was my first day at Liip and the beginning of my second year in my apprenticeship. I was very excited to meet all the Liipers at the office. First, I met Severin and Jana, who work on the first floor at Liip. Jana also started her apprenticeship at Liip today. Then I met Jens, who showed me my workspace and everything I need to work with. We followed the onboarding checklist and tried to set up everything on my laptop. However, we encountered a challenge because I have a Windows laptop, while literally everyone else has a MacBook. This made the situation difficult because the Windows terminal is built differently. Since we couldn't continue with the setup, I started to read the "Best Practices." I managed to get through 6 out of 18 practices before my day ended. It was a cool first day at Liip.
