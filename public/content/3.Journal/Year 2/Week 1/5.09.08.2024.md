Today, I went to the office earlier, and no one was there. I was a bit confused because no one was around. But I wrote down my journal entry from yesterday and started to work. When I tried to open my Journal Page and write in every journal I had before, I couldn't open it. So I did other things. After a while, I had nothing left to do, so I started to learn the 10-finger typing system. I made good progress until Jens came. Together, we tried to fix my page. Somehow we just had to wait, and it popped up automatically after about 10 minutes. At 11:00, I had a meeting with Anina. She explained the circle to me and what her roles are in it. Then I played a game where I learned Tailwind CSS. It was very fun. I also tested Tailwind on my page, and that was also fun.
