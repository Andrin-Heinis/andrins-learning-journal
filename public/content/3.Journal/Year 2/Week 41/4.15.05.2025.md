Today we continued working on NoSQL databases. We had to import data. I really enjoyed it because I already had good experience with it. We did it in many different ways. We also worked with Mongo DB Compass. In the afternoon, we continued working with Docker Composer. I learned what kind of commands I wanted to use. We also worked with MarianDB. Later, we had math. We're currently studying for the upcoming exam.
