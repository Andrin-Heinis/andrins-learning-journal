I started by fixing the last test. After an hour, it still wasn't working, so I turned my attention to other things, like writing in my journal. At some point, Noah came over and helped me. Neither of us could fix the problem, so he told me to continue working on the AOZ-40 ticket with Jens. Jens showed me what to do, and after the meeting I knew what to do. I set everything up and started working. It went really well. After a while, I had the new component finished and added the basic code. I made a lot of progress today.
