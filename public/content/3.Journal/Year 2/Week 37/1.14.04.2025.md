Today I prepared several laptops for the upcoming trial day to make sure everything was ready for the new students, which took some time but was quite straightforward. Then I had a sync with Migros where we discussed a few updates and made sure our data was aligned. After that I spent about half an hour updating my journal to keep everything documented properly. In the afternoon I focused on the user stories EKW-3212, EKW-3213 and EKW-3215. These stories are all part of the new design for job ads, where I worked on rendering the tasks, the profile section and the part for applications and contact. It was interesting to see how these different pieces come together in the new layout and I also checked some drafts to make sure everything fits.
