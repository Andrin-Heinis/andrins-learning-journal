Today I spent about two hours resetting laptops back to macOS since they were still configured for Windows after the trial day, which took a bit longer because of all the updates. After that I worked on Zebra timesheets and updated my journal to keep everything clean and up to date. In the afternoon I focused on the user stories EKW-3213 and EKW-3215, checked some drafts and made sure the design for the job ads was progressing well so itâ€™s ready for the next steps.
