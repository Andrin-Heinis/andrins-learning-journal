Today was the Schnuppertag for future application developers EFZ. In the morning I helped set up the arena with laptops, chargers, tables and the beamer, then did an intro round and presented a welcome PowerPoint about Liip. We showed them the office and explained HTML and CSS with W3Schools, which they later worked on themselves. After lunch we played a Kahoot, started the AI Shopping List project and had a short Q&A about IMD. At the end we discussed their reports and wrapped up the day. Later I updated my journal.
