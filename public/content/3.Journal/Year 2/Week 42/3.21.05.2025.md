When I got to the office, I started fixing some bugs I'd made yesterday. Then I moved on to the big teaser. I wanted to add the Blokkli code piece that would allow me to choose where to place the text box in the teaser. I tried many different options. One was globalOptions, for example. Unfortunately, that didn't work as expected. Then I tried two other options. They worked better, but it still wasn't good enough. Later, I worked with Jens. He showed me how to do it. And honestly, I was pretty close. I just forgot to release and import the function. In the end, everything looked clean, and I was very happy with it. After that, I fixed a few styling errors.
