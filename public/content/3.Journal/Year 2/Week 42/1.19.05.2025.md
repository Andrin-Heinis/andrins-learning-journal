I started the BigTeaser today. It was pretty bumpy at first. I had to research a lot of basic stuff, which was very annoying because the solutions were also very simple, and I should have guessed. After asking a few times, I finally managed it. I was almost able to complete the first of four parts. Later, I wrote more in my journal.
