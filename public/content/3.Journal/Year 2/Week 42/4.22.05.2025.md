I studied for two exams today. Luckily, I made a mistake and one didn't take place today. Unfortunately, another one did, and I didn't prepare for it. I still did very well, though. It was an exam about data compression and data encoding. I didn't like the subject, and I'm very glad it's finally over. This afternoon, I had a math exam on trigonometry, and luckily, that was the last one. I'm finally done with trigonometry after several months!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³ It was a very tiring day because I had to concentrate very often and for a long time, but I'm done. :D
