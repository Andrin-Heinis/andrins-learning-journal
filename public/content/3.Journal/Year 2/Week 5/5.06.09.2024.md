In the first two exams I had in English, we talked about the US electoral system because our English teacher is from the USA. After that we had an exam in ABU about the US electoral system. I had to explain by myself in 240 words how the US electoral system works. Also we had to fill out tables about Harris and Trump, the two most voted presidents right now.
