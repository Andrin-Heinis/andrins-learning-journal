Today was a school day. We had to choose a new presentation about a new theme. I chose Scrum Master. It was the only theme who looked interesting, or the other interesting themes were already taken. Then I started to write my presentation. In the other classes I had cloud systems, where I had to download a virtual machine. I already did that, so It was kind of boring. The other classes were the same every week. Also I had math.
