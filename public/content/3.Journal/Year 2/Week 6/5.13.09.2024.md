Today we first had the topic of "perfect holidays" in English and I thought about where I would travel and what I would like to experience there. Then in the politics lesson we prepared a debate about biodiversity in Switzerland. We discussed why biodiversity is important and what challenges there are in protecting it. After the politics lesson we talked about the Swiss electoral system, especially how direct democracy works and how citizens can vote regularly. Finally we had fitness. There we did some physical activity and worked on our stamina.
