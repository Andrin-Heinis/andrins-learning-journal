In Modul 322, I continued refining the design of the Zoo app, focusing on layout and visuals to make it look polished and user-friendly. For Modul 320, I’m still preparing for the upcoming exam by going through all the PDFs we received, covering key concepts like classes and objects to ensure I’m fully prepared. In Modul 426, I worked on the website, adding a grade button with a popup feature to improve the grade input experience. Modul 346 was focused on Amazon Cloud Services, although progress has been slower than I’d like as I’m still getting familiar with the setup. Finally, in math, we had a test, which allowed me to apply what we’ve been studying. Overall, it was a busy day with a mix of design, development, cloud learning, and exam prep.
