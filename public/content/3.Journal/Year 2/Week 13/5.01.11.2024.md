In the first lesson, we had English, and I presented a book I read called “A Town Like Alice”. I received a grade of 5 for the presentation, which I was satisfied with. It was a bit nerve-wracking to stand in front of the class, but I managed to convey the story and its themes effectively. Later, in ABU, we discussed the results of the US elections and their potential impact on the world. The discussion was engaging, as we explored how these results could influence global politics, economics, and even environmental policies. It was fascinating to connect such large-scale events to our daily lives and future prospects.
