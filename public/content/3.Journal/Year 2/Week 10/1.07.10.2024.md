I continued with the course today and reached Separate Logic From the Template. This lesson reinforced the importance of separating concerns in code. I had already seen this approach in web development before, so I found it quite straightforward. I also revisited my earlier work to refactor some code and make sure Iâ€™m properly applying these concepts. It was a good reminder of how essential clean code practices are, especially in larger projects.
