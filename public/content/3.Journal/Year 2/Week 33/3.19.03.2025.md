I started with my daily. After the daily, I did the Zebra Timesheets. Then I worked with Trent on fixing the deployment of my learning journal project, which took some time but helped me better understand the deployment flow. For the rest of the day, I focused on EKW-3212 and EKW-3213. I added the data from the database onto the site and adjusted the hover font size using Tailwind, and made several cleanups in the codebase. I also added two new icons to the styleguide. One of my commits was a checkpoint to go back in case something breaks, and I am so happy that I created that commit because it turned out that I accidentally broke my code and I couldn't find the mistake.
