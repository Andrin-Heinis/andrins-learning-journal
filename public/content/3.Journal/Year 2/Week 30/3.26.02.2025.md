I started with my daily as usual and checked in with the Migros Karriere team. After that, I had a longer sync session where I worked closely with Stefan. He explained several parts of the EKW-3212 redesign task, and we looked into how the system works and how I could apply the necessary changes. I asked questions whenever something was unclear and gradually understood how to approach the implementation. Later, I also took some time to update Zebra and my journal.
