The day started with a Sustainability ONB Training, which was held in German. It was a good opportunity to learn more about sustainable practices in the workplace. After the training, I attended the UX-Day in ZÃ¼rich. The UX-Day was a fascinating event focused on UX designs for websites. It took place in a dedicated room, with various talks covering the differences between buttons and links. It was an inspiring day, and I came away with lots of new ideas and approaches for future projects.
