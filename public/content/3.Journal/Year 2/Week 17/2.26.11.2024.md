I started the day by getting some Gipfeli for everyone, then prepared everything for the Schnuppertag. Once the Schnuppernden arrived, we began with a welcome presentation. Then, Manuel explained the basics of HTML and CSS so they could understand the structure before starting their project. They worked through the faulty HTML/CSS project, fixing mistakes and improving the layout. After that, JÃ¼rg gave a short introduction about Liip and did a quick Q&A session for about 30 minutes, where the Schnuppernden could ask questions. At the end, we discussed how well they worked, answered questions, and wrapped up the session by cleaning up. It was a long but productive day!
