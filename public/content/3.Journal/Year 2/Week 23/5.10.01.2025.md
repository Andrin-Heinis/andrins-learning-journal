I spent the day at school. In the morning we talked about a waterpark in Florida. In the afternoon we had ABU. The main focus was on finishing the project work for "Meine Gemeinde." I updated the work log, ensured the journal entry was complete, and finalized the conclusion. Everything had to be submitted by 13:15, so I made sure that both the documentation and the final product were properly prepared. After double-checking all files, I uploaded the project to OneDrive. It felt good to complete this long-term assignment. After submitting, we had to create a presentation about "Meine Gemeinde," but I misunderstood the task. Instead of focusing on the project itself, I prepared for the entire topic.
