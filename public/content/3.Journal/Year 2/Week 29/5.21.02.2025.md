We started with English with Jon, where we worked on different exercises together. The tasks included discussions, problem-solving, and collaborative work on various topics. We practiced reading, writing, and speaking, which helped us improve our overall language skills. Later, in ABU, we focused on different types of insurance. We analyzed various cases and learned how different policies apply in specific situations. Additionally, we went through evaluation criteria for our project and reviewed feedback on previous work, discussing key points about how insurance works in different scenarios.
