I intended to continue troubleshooting the pipeline issues, but Trent was absent, and without him, I was unable to proceed as he knew what needed to be done next. So instead, I focused on a different task and started my next course: a PHP course. I completed the first lesson, which I enjoyed, as it gave me a similar feeling to the Vue Mastery course I had done before.
