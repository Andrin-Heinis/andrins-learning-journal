I arrived at the office as usual at 8:30. After a quick glance at my Google Calendar, I began setting up the platform to host my website. At times, I encountered difficulties and had to ask Trent for assistance. Together, we attempted to resolve the issues, but we were met with one problem after another. Despite the challenges, we eventually made good progress and reached a solid checkpoint before wrapping up the day.
