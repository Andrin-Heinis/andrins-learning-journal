We started the day with an English class. I had prepared a book report, but as it turned out, we didn’t need to present it, which was a little frustrating since I had already done the work. Nonetheless, I was okay with it since it was completed. In the second lesson, I participated in a debate on biodiversity, as the voting day was approaching on Sunday. Both my opponent and I "cheated" a little, in a way, as we had already rehearsed the entire dialogue during English class when we didn’t have much else to do. Because of that, both of us received good grades for the debate. Afterward, we had a session on the Swiss voting system, during which we created posters and explained how our voting system works.
