I came a bit earlier to the office so I had enough time to test everything. Later, the other Liipers came to the office. I also wrote a message to JÃ¼rg because of the MacBook I need. When I had nothing to do left, I continued to test everything and see how tailwind works. Also I continued to learn the 10-finger system, because it will help me a lot later. Somewhen I asked Jens how to edit the paragraphs, and he showed me how to do it. Later I tried to change the icon of the website. I tried different things out, until I noticed that the website worked very slow or sometimes it didn't even worked. I asked Jens, and we figured out that Lando got destroyed. I tried to fix it, but it didn't worked, so I will wait til tomorrow, and John and I will try to fix it.
