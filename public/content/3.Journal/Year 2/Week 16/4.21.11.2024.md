I started with my daily as usual. Then, in Modul 322, I continued working on the Zoo App design, transferring it to Figma for better flexibility. In Modul 320, I prepared for Part 2 of the Object-Oriented Programming exam, focusing on associations. Later, in Modul 426, I worked on the grade management website, improving the register/login popup. For Modul 346, I completed KN02, finishing the chapter on cloud-based website programming. In Mathematics, I continued with Pythagoras, practicing different exercises. A solid mix of design, coding, and studying today.
