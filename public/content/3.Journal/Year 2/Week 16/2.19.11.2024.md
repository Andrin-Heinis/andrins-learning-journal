I started with my daily like always. After that, I worked 1 hour on a ticket to anonymize folder data. Then, I spent 45 minutes on hosting. I continued with the .sh files. Later, I joined the Apprentice tactical meeting for 30 minutes to talk about our tasks. After that, I worked 1 hour on my own PHP project to repeat what I learned in the course. The biggest part of my day was 4.5 hours of repeating Part 4 of my PHP course and comparing it with other projects to understand it better.
