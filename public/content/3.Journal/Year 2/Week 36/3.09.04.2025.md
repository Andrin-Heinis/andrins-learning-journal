I never had a more chaotic day like today. First I forgot my key and then I got into a bus accident. Nothing happened to me but because of that I had even more delay till I was at the Liip. When I was here I made a short daily together with Trent and after that together with the Migros Squad. And then I went down to prepare the laptops for the Schnuppertag. It was more work than I thought it was. I needed to update the computer list. When it was lunch time I went out and right after that I went to a doctor appointment. I came back after 1 and a half hours to the office and instantly continued preparing all the laptops.
