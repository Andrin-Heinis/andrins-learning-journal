I worked on three tickets today, EKW-3212, 3213 and 3215. I started with the 3212 one. I needed to fix the code, because I used pixels instead of rem. And it annoys me a bit that I forget it every time. But it fixed the code fast and after fixing I went straight to the next ticket. On EKW-3213 I had to add the backend data to the frontend. I really like to do that, because I understand very well how to do that. After that ticket I took a small break to prepare for the Schnuppertag in 2 weeks. I prepared the task for the Schnuppis again, because the task from last year wasnâ€™t clear enough to understand. After that I worked on the last ticket for today. It was EKW-3215. I needed to add some if and else code for the booleans. An example: If the recruiter from Migros Karriere wants to hide his email on the job-ad Stelle, then I need to remove the email from the frontend.
