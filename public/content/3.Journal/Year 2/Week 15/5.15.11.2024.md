In English, we talked about movies, sharing which ones we’ve seen and which ones we still want to watch. It was fun to exchange recommendations and hear different opinions. In Language and Communication, we started our project work with the theme “Heimat”. In groups, we discussed what Heimat means to each of us and shared our thoughts. In Politics, we continued with part two of our topic on political parties, diving deeper into their ideologies and how they influence policies. It was a day full of interesting discussions and collaborative work.
