​​I started the day with a 15-minute daily session to organize tasks and plan the workload. After that, I attended a 1-hour feedback training in German, specifically for apprentices and interns, which was helpful for improving communication and teamwork. Then, I spent another hour setting up my learning journal, ensuring everything was documented properly and up to date. The rest of the day, around 5.75 hours, I focused on the PHP course, repeating and reinforcing Parts I, II, and III. This helped me strengthen my understanding of the core concepts and improve my skills with practical exercises.
