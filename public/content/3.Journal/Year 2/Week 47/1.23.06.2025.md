Today, I was primarily preparing for tomorrow's Team Talk. I wanted to make sure everything was ready, so I reworked the project, made a few minor code improvements, and then uploaded everything neatly to GitHub. After that, I took care of the presentation - I created appropriate slides, adjusted the layout, and made sure everything was clear and understandable. I also took detailed notes so I can speak confidently and clearly during my presentation tomorrow. In addition to preparing for the Team Talk, I also fixed a small bug in a merge request that Noah noticed. It wasn't a major issue, but it was still important to ensure everything runs smoothly. At the end, I found some time to continue working on the ticket for the gallery.
