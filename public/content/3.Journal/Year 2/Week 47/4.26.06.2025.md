Our English teacher wasn't there today, so we were free to do whatever we wanted. I decided to correct my English book report. Later, we had German. We mainly planned what would happen in the coming weeks and then corrected our exams. Later, we also took a German exam. The topic was that we had to correct our own essays and thus find our own mistakes.
