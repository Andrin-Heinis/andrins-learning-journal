Today was a tiring day. We submitted a total of five different projects. I had a good feeling about all of them. I had to hand in three projects on Docker, one on Camunda, and one on English. I was very relieved when I handed everything back. I feel good about the projects. I also got a math exam back. I think it was worse than I thought, but not terribly bad.
