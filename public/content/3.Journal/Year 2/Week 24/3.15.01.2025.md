I started with my daily with Trent as usual. After that, I spent 8.5 hours installing Composer on every Drupal project for Fenaco. Similar to yesterday, I encountered many error messages, some of which I had never seen before. Troubleshooting them took quite some time, but I managed to resolve the issues and get everything running.
