After the daily, I basically spent the whole day installing my plugging on ASVZ. I had some problems with installing the plugging, because I got many error messages I never saw before. The process involved setting up dependencies, ensuring compatibility, and troubleshooting any issues that appeared. Some projects required additional configuration, but by the end of the day, everything was successfully installed and running as expected.
