Today I had a full day at vocational school. In the cloud computing module, I worked with Louis on KN03 about Cloud-init and AWS. We had to do some tasks and solve problems related to it. In programming, we learned more about inheritance and polymorphism. We worked on "is a" and "has a" tasks and tried to implement them in exercises. Also, we looked at class diagrams for generalization and specialization. There was also a task about polymorphism with birds. The LB3 test was announced, so now we can prepare for it.
