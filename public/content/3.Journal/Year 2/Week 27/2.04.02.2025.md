I started with my daily as usual. After that, I had a sync with Frank to align on some tasks and priorities. Later, I joined the Migros Scrum Events, which provided some insights into their workflow. I also attended a Liip Talk about Rust, focusing on performance and memory safety, which was quite interesting. In between, I participated in the Drupal ZH tactical meeting before continuing with creating patches locally for all Drupal projects.
