Today was a school day, and I was NOT happy with what I heard today. I got my grade back and it was a 4 instead of a 4.5 because I had 8 fucking points (out of 70 or so). I was really annoyed. But when I heard where I had lost those 8 points, I got really angry. There were some really easy questions at the beginning that I skipped because I thought I could answer them later. So I now have a 4.72 on my report card, which of course had to be rounded down to a 4.5. If I had gotten those 8 points, I would have had a 5 on my Zeugniss. Well, now it's happened. Super annoying, but that's how it is.
