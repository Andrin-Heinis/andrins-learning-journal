Today I also worked on the journal. I focused primarily on the tutorial because it wasn't looking good yet. Afterward, I contacted the MeinPlatz project. Leo found a few more bugs and commented on them. I tried to fix them all, but I didn't finish some of them. I hope to finish everything next Monday without resorting to ChatGPT or anything similar.
