My goal today was to finish my journal project. I added a lot of features and think I made really good progress. But when it came to adding new custom tools and other JS scripts, I honestly knew I wouldn't be using those scripts every day. But everything started crashing and getting weaker. I tried so hard and got so far, but in the end, it doesn't matter. I was so frustrated that I rolled back to an old, working commit and went home. When I have time tomorrow, I will try it again, because I have an idea how I can make it work.
