Today I mainly worked on the journal. I made a little tutorial. It was really fun to learn how to do it. I had to watch a YouTube video to understand how, but after about three hours, I managed to get it working. It worked immediately for the mobile version, too. By the way, I did the tutorial with localStorage. That gave me another idea: I wanted to add checkboxes to see what you've already read and what you haven't. I finished that today, too. I made a lot of progress today and was able to fix all the bugs I know of. :D
