Today I continued working on my journal. I was able to write a script that always prepares a post for the day. This saves me time and makes me more motivated to update my journal regularly. Later, I worked on my ticket with Leo. Our problem was that the work fields weren't included in the API, and we needed to add them. It worked after about an hour, and I was able to continue working on the front end. However, I encountered an issue there that took me a long time to dig around. And when I finally got help, the problem was found again within a few seconds ðŸ˜­. But after that, everything worked, and I was able to close the ticket successfully.
