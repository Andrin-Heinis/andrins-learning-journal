Today I was back at school after a long time. We started the modular subjects. However, since it was a new school year, we set up an app. This app is used to enter grades and manage other important documents, etc. This app is intended to replace what we had before. Later, we had the ABU (General and Special Education). We started with a topic that had already been announced. We're starting with preparation for the VA (in-depth work). I chose the topic "Antibiotics: Health Opportunities and Risks."
