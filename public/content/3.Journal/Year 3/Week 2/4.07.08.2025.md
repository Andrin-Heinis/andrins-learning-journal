Today I continued working on the ticket MEINPLATZ-717. I had to import the new and correct word and then I pretty much copy pasted Leoâ€™s code, to make it able to read the correct word in. And in the end it worked. Then I worked on the interactive map again. Leo found some bugs or just a false design and so on, and I fixed all of them. And after all of that, I started to set up my very own website for my Journal. It was easy to set up the basics, but buying a good domain and finding a good host was a bit difficult as expected.
