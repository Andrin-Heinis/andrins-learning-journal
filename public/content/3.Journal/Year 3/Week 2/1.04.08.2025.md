Today I continued working on the map and was able to finish it. There were a lot of problems, like the ID often not muting, or the map not displaying on small screens. But I was able to overcome all of them. There were some things that were very simple, like the ease in and out when I hover on a canton. But then there were also things that were very difficult, like the feature that creates an underline in the list when you hover over the specific canton.
