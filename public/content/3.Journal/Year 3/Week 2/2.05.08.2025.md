In my daily meeting with the MeinPlatz team, I received a new ticket to work on. I have to change the filter name to the singular. It was previously "Altersgruppen," but there's only one Altersgruppe. So I had to create a new key and finally remove the "n" from "Altersgruppen." The code is very difficult to understand, so I worked on the ticket until I went home earlier because I couldn't concentrate properly. I tried again at home, but it wasn't much better.
