Today was a work-focused day. I started in the morning by working on GEBS-1519 and creating a VRM link fix list. After that, I switched to MeinPlatz and changed the dev setup to use MariaDB instead of MySQL, which needed careful testing.

Later in the morning, I went back to GEBS-1519 and continued improving the fix list. I also had a short discussion meeting, which helped to clarify a few points. After lunch and ordering a drink, I continued working on MeinPlatz and GEBS-1519 again in the afternoon. The tasks were repetitive but important, and I stayed focused until the end of the day. Overall, it was a productive day with steady progress.
