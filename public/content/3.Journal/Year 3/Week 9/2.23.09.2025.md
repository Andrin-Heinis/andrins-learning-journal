Today, since I didn't have much work, I approached Noah. He immediately gave me several tickets from AOZ that I could work on. Most of them were bug reports, such as issues with paragraphs not having rounded corners. Another ticket, however, dealt with a hardcoded routing error. In the afternoon, I and Boris looked into what NPM actually is, as I hadn't quite understood it yet. He explained it very well, and now it makes much more sense. We also canceled today's tactical meeting; I just wanted to mention that in case anyone checks the journal becuase of that. ;)
