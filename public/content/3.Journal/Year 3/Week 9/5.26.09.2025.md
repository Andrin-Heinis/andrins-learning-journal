Today at school we worked on a business plan again. I had some homework to do, which I completed. But I misunderstood my teacher and ended up doing something similar (and even more complex), and he still got angry. I'll never understand these peoples 🙂‍↔️! In the afternoon, I had my extracurricular activity, and I had to continue working on my presentation about antibiotics. Today we also had a progress review, which resulted in a grade. Since I was extremely frustrated after the last one, I prepared a lot and implemented many of my ideas. It went very well, and I got a 5.1. That's quite low for my performance, but at least it wasn't below a 5. But as I said, I'll never understand these teachers 🙂‍↔️!
