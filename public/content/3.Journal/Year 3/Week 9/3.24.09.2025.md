This morning I worked on project AOZ-79. I had to change a URL. However, that didn't go very smoothly. Noah explained it to me later in the afternoon. In the morning, I tried to do it myself, and I had to import the current database. That was a bit tricky because the database was corrupted. But in the end, it worked. Then, in the afternoon, two more applicants arrived, and Max and I worked with them on some programming exercises.
