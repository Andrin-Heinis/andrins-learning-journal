Today I continued working on the AOZ project. I wanted to resolve ticket AOZ-59, but that didn't go very well, as my project stopped working. I tried for about an hour to get it running again, but then I gave up. So, I spent the rest of the time preparing for the "Future Day" event and writing messages. I also found two people today who are interested in participating. That made me happy, because I was a little worried that not enough people would be interested.
