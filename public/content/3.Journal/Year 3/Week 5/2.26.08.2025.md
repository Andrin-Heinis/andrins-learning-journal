Today I was tasked with finishing two tickets as quickly as possible. One is the ticket where the filer names weren't muted. Sometimes it was singular, sometimes it was plural. Anyway, I actually fixed that once before, but it broke other things, and I had to patch everything again, but that was easy. And the other problem was that I still had to fix Leo's commits. I did that today, too, but I didn't quite finish. I'll ask Leo tomorrow, and since he provided me with the code he did, I'm sure I'll get it done :)
