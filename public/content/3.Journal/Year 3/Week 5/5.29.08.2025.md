Today I had school, and we worked on the new module subjects. The first module subject was testing. We had a calculator code, and we had to have it tested because it was faulty. I wrote a test that performs a calculation with all possible operation symbols (+-*/) and checks whether it returns the expected result. It did this for + and -, but not for * and /, so I knew where to fix the code. After that, everything worked.

And in the afternoon, we had ABU, so I had to continue writing my VA about antibiotics. That wasn't so much fun because I'm still preparing the document and not writing the paper itself.

And later in English, our teacher had an idea that we could go see a play. Unfortunately, I can't go because it's dark inside there.
