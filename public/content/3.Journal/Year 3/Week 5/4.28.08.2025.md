Today I had absolutely nothing to do, and I was getting a bit bored. So I decided to do some things that weren't work-related, like restocking the fridge with drinks. While I was at it, I also made a list of the things we have in the elevator. This list helps me buy new things more quickly. In the afternoon, Leo gave me the go-ahead to merge the branches into develop. And then I saw a comment from Maya and fixed the bug she mentioned there. It went very well, and we merged the branch right away.
