Today is my first day of my third year of apprenticeship. I'm a little proud of myself of having come this far. Anyway, I had to "move my stuff over" today, as I've changed circles. I left the Drupal Circle and joined the Custom and Commerce Circle. I'll probably stay there for this semester before changing the circle again. I set up the MeinPlatz project and tried to understand how it works. For example, Drupal has a Blökkli editor. And in this editor, you can combine different paragraphs. In this project we use October CMS. I didn’t check everything, but I have a feeling that I will understand this tool very fast, because it is very similar to Drupal.
