My main goal today was to finish the ticket. Since I couldn't figure out how to use the API to retrieve the JobType fields, I decided to wait until Monday. So, I wanted to finish the journal page today. I put a lot of work into the design. About 2-2.5 hours. After testing everything, it turned out it had a few bugs, and I wanted to know if there were any better design ideas. So I gave my code to ChatGPT, and he created a much better design for me, with no bugs and much better accessibility than I could üòê. In the end, I had a pretty good-looking journal page. But there's still a lot to do.
