Leo explained to me how the API code works in the backend. He showed me how to set the URL and how to connect it to the controller so it can respond to requests. I learned how the function receives parameters like the locale and ID or slug, and how it fetches the right data from the database. It was interesting to see how the offers are linked to institutions and how sorting can be applied using pagination. That was btw the part where I did “Oha” and “Aha, now I understand it” all the time.
