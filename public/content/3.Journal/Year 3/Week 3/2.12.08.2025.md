Today Leo gave me a new task. I had to create an iframe for every institution. And the institution Brändi wanted an “extension” to their iframe. They asked for it to be grouped by work fields instead of locations, so it can be embedded directly on their website. A new iframe now supports a URL parameter to filter by work field, showing only the relevant offers. I knew I had to start in the backend, but it looked so complicated, that I began to ask Leo how everything works.
Also I missed the daily today, and we had to do it at 11:00 (I was so ashamed 😭)
