In school, we were still working on the topic of testing. We looked at automated testing, which was extremely interesting. However, since it's a bit more complicated, I didn't quite keep up, and I have to do a lot of work at home. Later, we had our ABU (Academic Business Unit) class. I had my interview last weekend (September 14th), and it went very well. In school, I then transcribed everything into the document. That was much easier than I expected. Later, we had English class. As always, we mostly chatted (which, surprisingly, really helps me, I don't know why), and only did 2 or 3 exercises together.
