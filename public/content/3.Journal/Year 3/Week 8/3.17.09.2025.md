Today we had another interview in the morning with two students who are applying for an apprenticeship. I did some coding exercises with them again, which was a lot of fun. Yesterday I always made notes about their personalities and such, but today I skipped that since I was so busy with them. Later, I set up the Teamtailor project with Tim. We looked at the auto-responses and the job description, etc.  Everything worked very well.
