I didn't have much to do today. I started working on a new website. It's a website that functions like a to-do list. The advantage is that you can now go to the fridge and easily check what drinks you need to restock. This way you have a good overview, and you don't have to keep going back and forth to the store. However, I didn't finish it today.
