Today I missed the station, which is why I was a bit pissed off in the morning. But after getting a mate, I felt better again :D Later in the day was the Apprentices Talk. Today I remembered that I hadn't prepared anything, and that's why I was a bit stressed. I did a quick presentation and practiced a bit. After that, I had to go and present it straight away. I don't think I did it very well. Later in the afternoon, two more applicants came for the 2026 apprenticeship. MÃ¤x and I did programming with them while Monika and Noah conducted a short interview with them.
