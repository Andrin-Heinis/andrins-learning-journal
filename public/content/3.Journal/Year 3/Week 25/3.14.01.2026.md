Today was a full and active day. I started in the morning by working on GEBS-1519 and creating domain groups, which took quite some focus. After a short break, I continued with the same task to make sure everything was correct and finished properly.

Later, I prepared for the apprentices talk. I spent time getting my points ready and thinking about what I wanted to explain about NPM. Then I realised, that I dont have a demonstration. I got a bit stressed but then I created an actually good one. After lunch, I finished the preparation and then held the apprentices talk, which went ok but it felt rewarding.

In the afternoon, I worked on MEINPLATZ-729 and did the data import for the Italian version on production. It was a longer task, but I stayed focused until the end. Overall, the day was busy but productive, and I am happy with what I achieved.
