Today was a long and busy day. In the morning, I started with GEBS-1519 and worked on creating domain groups. After that, I continued with MEINPLATZ-729 and worked on the data import for the Italian version on production. This task took a lot of time and focus.

Later, I joined a short talk about security practices in our projects, which was interesting to listen to. Around midday, I continued working on the MEINPLATZ-729 import script and made good progress. In the afternoon, there were a few meetings and talks, including one about how our work is changing. Between meetings, I went back to GEBS-1519 and kept working on the domain groups. At the end of the day, I also checked some Zebra timesheets. It was a full day, but I managed to get a lot done and stayed focused until the end.
