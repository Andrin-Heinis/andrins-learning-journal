Today was a busy but okay day. I started in the morning by finishing a task for GEBS-1519 and fixing the setup and the ReadMe. After that, I did some administration work. Later in the morning, I helped with the go-live of the Italian Meinplatz, which was interesting to see.

At midday, I worked again on GEBS-1519 and created the domain groups. In the afternoon, I spent time writing my journal and doing school work. The day was well planned, and even if it was a bit long, I managed everything and felt good about the progress I made.
