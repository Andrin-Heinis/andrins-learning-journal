Today was a school day and also a very exhausting one. The evening before, I worked on my school projects until 4 a.m. because I had important deadlines, so I started the day with very little sleep. In the morning, I focused on finishing my final projects and my personal learning journal, which had to be submitted today.

Even though I was really tired, I tried to stay focused during the day. Later, I went to Exergames in Zurich, which helped me clear my head a bit. After that, I had English class, which was challenging because of the lack of sleep. Overall, it was a stressful school day, but I am glad I managed to get through it and complete my tasks.
