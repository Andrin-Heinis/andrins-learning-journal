My goal today was to make as much progress as possible on the bug tracking ticket. This ticket consists of 16 smaller tasks. Last week, I only managed to complete one task and got stuck on the image issue, since I couldn't see the images. Today, Noah helped me with the images, and then I could continue. However, I still couldn't complete the ticket. The problem is that when the screen size decreases, the image zooms in instead of being cropped. I still need to fix this, but I'm extremely confused because this behavior was already defined in the design specifications.
