I started my day with lots of small tasks, like practicing touch typing. I've been doing that for a few days now, because at 17 I still can't do it properly, but it's about time I learned! ðŸ¥² After that, I contacted the IT support team and tried to fix the issue with the icons. However, that didn't work very well, because the code used for the icons is very different in each location. That just made everything more complicated, and in the end I gave up because I couldn't figure out how the code actually works. I'll try again next Monday, and I'm sure it will work better then. :)
