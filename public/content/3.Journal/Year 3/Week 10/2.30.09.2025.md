I continued working on the AOZ-59 ticket, as I wanted to finally make some progress. I had to figure out why the icons become smaller and unaligned when viewed on mobile. I knew how to fix it, but I didn't quite finish because it looked like Nina was currently editing the page. So, I moved on to the next ticket. There, I had to make sure that any links were centered. I managed to do that, but again, Nina was editing the page. Therefore, I did other things first, such as going to get milk for coffee with Tim.
