Today I wasn't particularly productive, as besides working on the AOZ-59 ticket (which I'm still working on), I had a lot of other tasks to complete. Together with Tim and Moni, I discussed Ursina's feedback regarding the recruitment of interns. Several questions arose during this discussion, which we then clarified together. Additionally, Tim and I reviewed the feedback about the drinks in the refrigerator and discussed which drinks we need to replace or purchase.
