Another boring day of school that I had to endure. In the module subjects, we had testing. We had to download a project that was structured like a banking app. And then we had to run the app, and then test whether everything worked, etc. And I sat back a bit because I had already done that last week. Later, we had ABU, and that's when we got our first grade from our first midterm interview. It was lower than expected. I was a bit frustrated, but I knew I still had the best grade in the class. I think my teacher sometimes grades our projects a bit incorrectly. But it is what it is.
