Leo did a little handover for Mäx, Tim, and me. He gave us the role of "office supply" because he's going to do community service. Since we trainees spend a lot of time in the office, we'll be taking on that task. Later, Tim, Mäx, and I adapted the program for the Schnuppertag. It took longer than expected, but it was still a lot of fun :D. Afterward, Mäx and I spent a long time working on the project the trainees will be working on. Tim came back later, and we planned even more things for the Schnuppertag.
