Today I did a few small things related to the MeinPlatz project. But that only took about 10 minutes. Later, I worked on the AI ​​project for about 30 minutes because I wanted to fix something small. After that, I talked to Noah about the Future Day. Noah then gave me the organizational role. Right after that, I started preparing for the Future Day. I looked at everything very carefully and tried to figure out what I could reuse from last time and what still needed to be done.
