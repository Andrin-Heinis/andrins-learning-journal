This morning, I saw that Maya had found a bug in a ticket, and I quickly fixed it with Leo. Then I continued working on the journal. I actually wanted to create a short tutorial on the index page, but it became too complicated and confusing, so I rolled back and will try again tomorrow. Then I chatted briefly with David, and he noticed that we should add an effect to the map when we hover over the corresponding canton in the list. I quickly implemented and deployed it. Looks cool! :D
