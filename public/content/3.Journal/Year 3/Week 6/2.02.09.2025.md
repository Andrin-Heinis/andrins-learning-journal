Today was a special day! Because today we deployed everything to live. It was obviously special for me because today, for the first time, I'm seeing changes on the web where I programmed. And I also know that a lot of people will now be using the feature I created. I'm really happy about that. Otherwise, I worked on the journal. I actually wanted to add a feature where you have to request access, but that didn't work out so well, and I gave up after about 2-3 hours, unfortunately. But I think the feature would have made everything a bit more complicated, so it was probably better this way. Later, I wanted to try something small: I wanted to program an AI, or rather, the AI ​​should develop itself. I made two different games, and the AI ​​is currently training this. But I found it so exciting that I lost track of time. I'll definitely link the GitHub project when I'm done, so you can see what I've done. It was definitely very educational and I had a lot of fun because I now have a better understanding of how AI is evolving. :D
