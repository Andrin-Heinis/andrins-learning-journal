Today was school again. In the morning, I had modular subjects. Together with my classmate, I had to solve a problem involving an imaginary company. They were selling too many records, which was causing them stress, and they were still using paper. They now wanted to set up an online shop and sell everything online. My classmate and I had to write a project proposal and present it. In the afternoon, we were in the forest, and we had to learn about ropes and knots. I didn't find that fun at all, though, because it was raining, and I slipped at least 15 times (and got dirty).
