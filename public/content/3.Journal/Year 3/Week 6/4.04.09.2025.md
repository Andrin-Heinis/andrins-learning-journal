The goal today was to finish most of the preparations for Future Day. I spent many hours taking documents from last year and updating them with this year's dates and names. However, I didn't get very far, as there's still a lot left to do. Later, I turned to the AI ​​project a bit and tried to integrate the desktop game "Snake." Adding the game worked well, but playing the game afterwards didn't work so well, unfortunately. But that will definitely come! :D
